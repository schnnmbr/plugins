Add custom headers to each page/post/custom post type. Header options include: featured image, custom image, slideshows, HTML, scripts, and more. 

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com).

Originally designed to allow the easy addition of custom images and featured images to selected posts, this plugin was greatly expanded to provide a wide range of header content options which are listed below. It is important to mention that this plugin does *not* add headers to every page of your site like some other plugins in the Wordpress plugin repository. Genesis Custom Headers simply allows you to add customized headers to pages, posts, and public custom post types.

Also this plugin purposefully includes minimal styling so that custom headers can adapt to your site. Therefore, custom CSS will occasionally need to be added to achieve the precise aesthetic you are looking for. Custom CSS can be added directly from the plugin Settings Page. If you have questions or would like to request additional features, let me know in the plugin support forum. 

= Header Content Options =
* Display the featured image
* Display a custom image
* Display slideshows using shortcodes or directly using one of the natively supported slider plugins
* Display custom content (Using the Wordpress tinymce editor)
* Display iframes, or raw HTML content (Great for Google maps) 
* Run page/post specific scripts 
* Set a global header position or page/post specific header positions using Genesis hooks
* Enable custom headers on any *public* custom post type

= Natively Supported Slider Plugins =
* [Soliloquy](http://soliloquywp.com/)
* [Revolution Slider](http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-revolution-responsive-wordpress-plugin/2751380)
* [Meta Slider](http://www.metaslider.com/)
* [Slider Pro](http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-pro-wordpress-premium-slider-plugin/253501)

**Disclaimer:** 
Genesis Custom Headers does not actually include copies of the slider plugins listed above, or any slider plugin for that matter. It just supports these plugins if you already have one of them installed on your website. 

== Installation ==

1. You have a couple options:
	* *Go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Genesis Custom Headers”. Once found, click "Install".
	* *Download the folder from Wordpress.org and zip the folder. Then upload via Plugins->Add New->Upload.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. From the ‘Plugins’ page, head directly to the plugin ‘Settings’ page to configure your global options.
4. Once the global settings have been set, navigate to a post, page, or custom post type, and edit the ‘Genesis Custom Headers’ metabox to your liking. If you have any implementation questions, please post in the plugin support forum.

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). If you do not have Genesis 2.0+ or Wordpress 3.6+, the plugin will not activate.
