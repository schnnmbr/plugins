= 3.4.1 : 14-Nov-2013 =

ADDED: Option to override the "Full width content" to show as excerpts.

FIXED: Missing line breaks in WYSIWYG custom fields
FIXED: Caption to show when image is in the title

FIXED: Custom field showing groups 1 for all groups
FIXED: Focal point not working with attached/embedded images
FIXED: Strange alignments with entry titles when padding or margins added in Design Mode. Something had made the linked titles inline instead of inline-block.
